Instagram Challenge
===================

## Instructions

* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc., but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Mongo, Express, and Node with React as an extra challenge. 

## User Stories:

You'll need **users** who can: 
* post **pictures**, 
* write **comments** on pictures, 
* **like** a picture. 
* Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).
* Bonus if you can add filters!

## How to start

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new JavaScript project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## Code Quality

For linting, you can lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!

-----------------------

This is a Node.js template for this instagram-challenge engineering project.

It uses:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework for Node.js.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to reload the server automatically.
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to render view templates.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) to model objects in MongoDB.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for linting.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing.
- [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) for password encyption
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for css templating

## Quickstart

### Install Node.js

1. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)
   ```
   brew install nvm
   ```
   Then follow the instructions to update your `~/.bash_profile`.
2. Open a new terminal
3. Install the latest long term support (LTS) version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), currently `16.14.0`.
   ```
   nvm install 16
   ```

### Set up your project

1. Fork this repository
2. Rename your fork to `instagram-challenge-<team name>`
3. Clone your fork to your local machine
4. Install Node.js dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Install an ESLint plugin for your editor. For example: [linter-eslint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint) for Atom.
6. Install MongoDB
   ```
   brew tap mongodb/brew
   brew install mongodb-community@4.4
   ```
7. Start MongoDB
   ```
   brew services start mongodb-community@4.4
   ```

### Start

1. Start the server
   ```
   npm start
   ```
2. Browse to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Test

- Run all tests
  ```
  npm test
  ```
- Run a check
  ```bash
  npm run lint              # linter only
  npm run test:unit         # unit tests only
  npm run test:integration  # integration tests only
  ```

#### Start test server

The server must be running locally with test configuration for the
integration tests to pass.

```
npm run start:test
```

This starts the server on port `3030` and uses the `instagram-challenge_test` MongoDB database,
so that integration tests do not interact with the development server.

## MongoDB Connection Errors?

Some people occasionally experience MongoDB connection errors when running the tests or trying to use the application. Here are some tips which might help resolve such issues.

- Check that MongoDB is installed using `mongo --version`
- Check that it's running using `brew services list`
- Try swapping `localhost`, everywhere that it appears in your codebase, with `127.0.0.1`. It might be surprising but this does sometimes make a difference.

If you have issues that are not resolved by these tips, please reach out to a coach and, once the issue is resolved, we can add a new tip!
